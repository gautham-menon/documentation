2. Copy the API key and paste it with in the Authorization header over on CleverTap.
3. Enable Postback URL from Preferences within Engage. Our docs on the [notification engine](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/notification-engine/#postback-webhook--url) shows how to enable this from the preferences.
4. Paste the callback URL generated by CleverTap within the fields shown on the integrations page.

## Templates

You can generate regular templates through our [template creation module](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/overview). These template names can be used directly within CleverTap.

To dynamically change text within a template you can make use of **Freeform templates**.

### Freeform templates

These can be used to pass dynamic text over on CleverTap. For this, 2 separate templates need to be generated

1. Freeform Text template
   This is a template with just a variable {{1}} passed into the template. Once approved, you can pass that template as a field within the integrations page.

2. Freeform media template
   This follows the same behaviour as the text template but with a media file attached at the time of approval. This media can be dynamically changed over on CleverTap.

Once the templates have been approved, pass both of these template names into the integration page fields.
